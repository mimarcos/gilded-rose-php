# gilded-rose-php

Credit goes to [emilybache](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata) for preparing this in _so many languages_.

The reason this repo was created instead of forked was to prevent any visibility into the requirements which, for the purpose of this exercise, were intended to be hidden.
